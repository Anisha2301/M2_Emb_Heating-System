# Intorduction
The Seat Heating and Monitoring System is capable of keeping car seats at the desired temperature. The button sensor in our project checks if the passenger is sitting or not, and once seated, the passenger must select the temperature according to his or her needs, after which the seat begins to heat and the corresponding temperature is displayed on the LCD.
