# Intorduction
The Seat Heating and Monitoring System is capable of keeping car seats at the desired temperature. The button sensor in our project checks if the passenger is sitting or not, and once seated, the passenger must select the temperature according to his or her needs, after which the seat begins to heat and the corresponding temperature is displayed on the LCD.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1.GCC erorr in windows and linux: installed the gcc msys64 mingw64 properly.

2.Generation of makefile: To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.

3.Unity testing: Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.
